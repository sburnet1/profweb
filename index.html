I won't waste your time telling you a bunch of useless facts about myself
like I have done all of these neat things in school thus far.  Instead, I 
aim to give you a taste of the real me; the person who you would get know
and who you would really be working with.  Yes, my name is Steve, not Steven 
or Stephen. I am building my foundation for my own family.  I in general
like to consider myself a 'home'body.  Although I may have quite the attitude, 
I can be a really nice person that is great to have as a friend.  Since this 
is not a personal blog, I will let you all continue on with the intention of 
this website. Please take a look at my resume and portfolio of some of my 
favorite projects to date and if you have any questions, contact me through 
any of the listed methods in Contact Info.
